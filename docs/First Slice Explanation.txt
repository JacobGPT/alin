——————  
  
TBWO — Time-Budgeted Work Order  
  
A Time-Budgeted Work Order is a structured request where the user grants ALIN explicit, bounded authority to plan and execute real work within a defined time and scope—while producing inspectable proof.  
  
Why it exists  
  
TBWO is how ALIN does serious work without becoming an unbounded agent.  
  
It solves three problems at once:  
	1.	Scope creep (work expanding silently)  
	2.	Trust gaps (“What did it actually do?”)  
	3.	Agent drift (free-roaming autonomy)  
  
⸻  
  
What makes a TBWO different from a normal task  
  
A normal AI task is:  
	•	“Build me a website”  
	•	“Design this in Blender”  
	•	“Work on this overnight”  
  
A TBWO is:  
	•	Explicit  
	•	Bounded  
	•	Inspectable  
	•	Reversible (where possible)  
  
⸻  
  
Core components of a TBWO  
  
Every TBWO contains:  
	1.	Objective  
	•	What outcome is being produced  
	2.	Time Budget  
	•	e.g. 30 minutes, 6 hours, 1 week  
	•	Enforced at planning and execution  
	3.	Scope  
	•	Files, tools, domains, surfaces it may touch  
	•	Nothing outside this boundary is allowed  
	4.	Quality Target  
	•	e.g. “Apple-level clean,” “production-ready,” “draft”  
	5.	Execution Plan  
	•	Milestones mapped to the time budget  
	•	Visible before work begins  
	6.	Authority Gates  
	•	What requires approval  
	•	What may run autonomously (if any)  
	7.	Receipts  
	•	Proof of what was done, changed, or produced  
	•	No receipt = no action  
	8.	Stop Conditions  
	•	When ALIN must halt and ask instead of guessing  
  
⸻  
  
What a TBWO is not  
  
A TBWO is not:  
	•	an always-on agent  
	•	a “do whatever you think is best” mode  
	•	a swarm of autonomous AIs  
	•	silent background control  
	•	magical execution without oversight  
  
It is delegation, not surrender.  
  
⸻  
  
Example (Website Sprint TBWO)  
  
“Build a premium single-page marketing site for my product.  
Time budget: 1 week.  
Stack: static + modern framework.  
Quality: Apple-level clean.  
Deliverable: local build + repo.  
Do not deploy live.”  
  
ALIN:  
	•	plans the week  
	•	spawns controlled pods  
	•	produces artifacts  
	•	delivers receipts  
	•	stops when the budget ends  
  
⸻  
  
Why TBWO is critical to ALIN  
  
TBWO is the mechanism that allows ALIN to feel extremely powerful while remaining:  
	•	trustworthy  
	•	bounded  
	•	auditable  
	•	canon-aligned  
  
Without TBWO:  
	•	ALIN becomes MoltBot-like  
	•	autonomy expands invisibly  
	•	trust collapses over time  
  
With TBWO:  
	•	power scales  
	•	trust compounds  
	•	authority stays human-owned  
  
⸻  
  
One-line memory anchor  
  
TBWO = “You may do this, for this long, in this space, and you must show your work.”  
  
———  
Idea  
———  
1) Single most compelling flagship TBWO template for First Slice  
Flagship TBWO: “Website Sprint” (Premium Production Mode)  
Why this one, over Blender or anything else:  
	•	Universally legible outcome  
A finished website is immediately understandable to any user. No explanation needed. Blender outputs are impressive but domain-specific; websites are culturally obvious proof.  
	•	End-to-end production pipeline  
It exercises every ALIN primitive without expanding scope:  
	•	clarification questions  
	•	time budgeting  
	•	planning  
	•	agent pods (design / frontend / motion / copy / QA)  
	•	artifact versioning  
	•	receipts  
	•	rollback  
	•	delivery  
	•	High “human-team illusion” without deception  
It genuinely feels like “a small team worked on this,” while remaining inspectable and auditable — perfect alignment with Spectacle & Surface doctrine.  
	•	Natural upsell anchor  
“Website Sprint” cleanly justifies a paid tier without contaminating Canon. It’s a first-party execution template, not general autonomy.  
	•	Low regulatory / safety risk  
Compared to finance, social posting, or personal automation, a website build is low-risk and reversible.  
Constraint that keeps it safe:  
It ships as one curated template, not “ALIN can build anything for a week.”  
⸻  
2) Top 3 failure modes in the first 90 days  
These are not generic “AI is bad” risks — they’re ALIN-specific risks given your bibles.  
⸻  
Failure Mode #1: Output is “technically fine” but not premium  
Symptom:  
The site works, but users say:  
“This is good… but not Apple-level.”  
Why this is dangerous:  
Your flagship promise is taste + integration, not just correctness. A mediocre site collapses the Spectacle engine.  
Root cause:  
	•	weak design system synthesis  
	•	inconsistent spacing/typography  
	•	animations that feel generic  
	•	overfitting to references without taste arbitration  
Mitigation (aligned with canon):  
	•	lock the template to 1–2 opinionated design languages at launch  
	•	constrain animation patterns  
	•	introduce a Design Lead Pod whose sole job is coherence, not generation  
	•	bias toward fewer sections, fewer animations, higher polish  
This is a taste problem, not a model problem.  
⸻  
Failure Mode #2: The clarification phase feels like friction, not intelligence  
Symptom:  
Users feel ALIN is “asking too many questions” before starting.  
Why this is dangerous:  
It violates your friction rule:  
	•	remove cognitive friction  
	•	keep agency friction  
If clarification feels bureaucratic, the magic dies before it starts.  
Root cause:  
	•	unclear minimum spec threshold  
	•	lack of inference from user history  
	•	ALIN acting like a form, not a collaborator  
Mitigation:  
	•	cap clarification to 3–5 questions max  
	•	always present assumed defaults (“I’ll assume X unless you say otherwise”)  
	•	use user history silently to prefill taste and stack choices  
	•	allow “start now, refine later” checkpoints  
Clarification should feel like competence, not compliance.  
⸻  
Failure Mode #3: Receipts are correct but not useful  
Symptom:  
Receipts exist, but users don’t look at them.  
Why this is dangerous:  
Receipts are one of ALIN’s core differentiators. If they’re ignored, you lose trust leverage.  
Root cause:  
	•	receipts too verbose  
	•	too technical  
	•	not tied to visible outcomes  
Mitigation:  
	•	dual-layer receipts:  
	•	Executive summary (“What I did, what changed, what’s left”)  
	•	Deep audit (files, diffs, commits)  
	•	inline receipts directly attached to artifacts (“This animation came from X”)  
	•	make rollback tangible (“Revert motion system” button)  
Receipts must earn attention, not demand it.  
⸻  
3) One concrete metric that proves it’s working  
Metric: “Reconstruction Refusal Rate” (RRR)  
Definition:  
After a Website Sprint completes, ask this single question 7–14 days later:  
“If ALIN disappeared tomorrow, would you rebuild this site from scratch yourself?”  
Success threshold:  
	•	≥60% answer “No” → the TBWO worked  
	•	≥75% → you have a genuine flagship  
Why this metric is canon-perfect:  
	•	It directly measures reconstruction cost, your stated moat  
	•	It’s not vanity (not time saved, not tokens, not wow)  
	•	It reflects trust + dependency, not novelty  
	•	It scales to other TBWOs later  
If users wouldn’t rebuild without ALIN, you’ve crossed from “cool tool” into infrastructure.  
⸻  
Final synthesis (important)  
If only one TBWO exists in First Slice, Website Sprint is the correct choice because:  
	•	it proves ALIN’s thesis without expanding authority  
	•	it creates an undeniable, legible artifact  
	•	it stresses every subsystem you care about  
	•	it fails loudly if ALIN isn’t actually good yet  
Everything else (Blender, video, apps, docs) becomes easier after this.  
  
———-  
**Website Sprint — End-to-End Experience Flow**  
(First-Party Premium Execution Mode)  
———-  
  
**0. Purpose of This Flow**  
Website Sprint exists to answer one user question unmistakably:  
“Can ALIN take responsibility for something real, over time, and deliver it like a disciplined human team—without losing my trust?”  
This flow is designed to:  
* feel serious, calm, and professional    
* demonstrate parallel competence    
* keep the user in control without micromanaging    
* make ALIN feel structurally necessary, not impressive-for-a-minute   
  
**1. Entry Point: How a User Starts a Website Sprint**  
Website Sprint is never hidden and never ambient.  
It is entered through explicit intent.  
**Entry surfaces:**  
* “New Website Sprint” button inside a Project    
* “Start a Website Sprint” from ALIN command input    
* Contextual suggestion (rare):   “This looks like a good fit for a Website Sprint. Want me to propose one?”    
ALIN never auto-escalates into a Sprint.  
  
**2. Preflight Screen: Commitment Before Execution**  
Before any questions or work begin, ALIN presents a Preflight Summary:  
“Website Sprint — Before We Start”  
Shown clearly:  
* What a Website Sprint is    
* What it will do    
* What it will not do    
* That it will:    
    * use time-budgeted execution    
    * spawn controlled agent pods    
    * produce inspectable artifacts + receipts    
* That it requires explicit approval    
This step filters unserious usage and sets tone.  
  
  
**3. Clarification Phase (Strictly Bounded)**  
**Rules (hard constraints):**  
* Maximum 5 questions    
* Each question includes a default assumption    
* Questions must reduce risk of wrong build, not over-specify    
**Example experience:**  
ALIN says:  
“I’ll ask a few questions so I don’t build the wrong thing. I’ll assume sensible defaults where possible.”  
Questions feel like confidence, not bureaucracy.  
Each question appears one at a time, not as a form.  
User can:  
* answer    
* accept default    
* say “decide for me”    
Clarification ends decisively. No loops.  
  
  
**4. Sprint Plan Reveal (The First “Oh Shit” Moment)**  
ALIN produces a Sprint Plan before doing any work.  
This is a single, calm screen, not a wall of text.  
**The plan shows:**  
* Scope summary (pages, style, stack)    
* Time budget allocation (e.g. design / build / motion / QA)    
* Agent Pods to be used    
* Deliverables    
* Known risks or tradeoffs    
Language is factual, not salesy.  
At the bottom:  
“Approve Plan & Begin Sprint”  
Nothing runs until this is clicked.  
This moment establishes:  
* authority separation    
* professional discipline    
* user trust    
**5. Execution Phase: What the User Sees While Work Happens**  
**Core principle:**  
The user is never locked out of their computer.  
Website Sprint runs alongside their life, not on top of it.  
  
**5.1 Website Sprint Dashboard**  
Once execution starts, the user sees a dedicated Sprint Dashboard.  
It shows:  
* Current stage (Planning / Design / Build / Motion / QA)    
* Active Agent Pods (by role, not personality)    
* Time remaining    
* Next checkpoint    
* Autonomy status (always visible)    
No animation fluff. Calm motion only.  
  
  
**5.2 Agent Pod Visibility (Without Anthropomorphism)**  
Pods are shown as roles, not characters.  
Example:  
* Design Pod — Active    
* Frontend Pod — Waiting on Design    
* Motion Pod — Scheduled    
* QA Pod — Pending    
Pods do not “talk.”  
They produce outputs.  
This avoids fake sentience while preserving spectacle.  
  
  
**5.3 Progress Without Interruption**  
While the Sprint runs:  
* User can:    
    * browse    
    * code    
    * watch YouTube    
    * leave the computer    
* ALIN does not:    
    * steal focus    
    * move the mouse    
    * pop modal interruptions    
Progress appears as non-invasive updates:  
* “Design system drafted.”    
* “Components compiling cleanly.”    
* “Motion pass ready for review.”    
Each update links to evidence.  
  
  
**6. Checkpoints (Human-in-the-Loop Without Friction)**  
At predefined milestones, ALIN may pause briefly.  
Checkpoint prompts look like:  
“Here’s the direction. Do you want me to continue, adjust, or hold?”  
User options:  
* Continue    
* Small adjustment    
* Pause    
* Cancel Sprint    
No pressure language. No urgency theater.  
  
  
**7. Artifact Preview (Seeing Work, Not Promises)**  
As artifacts become available, ALIN surfaces them immediately.  
Examples:  
* Live local preview    
* Static render    
* File tree    
* Diff between versions    
User can:  
* inspect    
* comment    
* ignore and let it continue    
Nothing is hidden behind “final reveal” theatrics.  
  
  
**8. Completion Moment (Second “Oh Shit” Moment)**  
When the Sprint completes, ALIN does not celebrate.  
It delivers.  
**Final delivery includes:**  
* Working website artifacts    
* Clear run / build instructions    
* Receipt Bundle (collapsed by default)    
* “What’s done / What’s left / What I’d do next”    
Tone:  
“Here’s what I built. Here’s how it works. Here’s what I’d improve if you want to continue.”  
This restraint is critical.  
  
  
**9. Receipts: Proof Without Overwhelm**  
Receipts are shown in two layers:  
**9.1 Executive Receipt (default view)**  
* What was built    
* Assumptions made    
* Tradeoffs due to time    
* Known limitations    
**9.2 Deep Audit (expandable)**  
* Files created / modified    
* Build logs    
* Pod outputs    
* Rollback options    
Receipts are:  
* readable    
* skimmable    
* optional to dive into    
Trust is offered, not forced.  
  
  
**10. Post-Sprint Reflection (Trust Accumulation)**  
After a short delay (days, not minutes), ALIN asks one question:  
“If this disappeared tomorrow, would you rebuild it yourself?”  
No rating scales.  
No dopamine loops.  
This feeds internal validation, not vanity metrics.  
  
  
  
**11. Why This Flow Works (Canon Alignment)**  
This experience:  
* proves continuity    
* demonstrates parallel competence    
* preserves user authority    
* avoids emotional dependence    
* creates reconstruction cost    
* scales to future TBWOs cleanly    
It feels like:  
“A calm, competent system that handled something real.”  
Not:  
“A cool AI demo.”  
  
  
**12. Explicit Non-Goals of This Experience**  
Website Sprint is not:  
* instant    
* magical    
* anthropomorphic    
* self-expanding    
* opaque    
* addictive    
It is:  
* deliberate    
* inspectable    
* bounded    
* professional

Website Sprint First Slice  
———————-  
Time-Budgeted Work Order (TBWO) — Spec v1.0  
Classification: First-Party Premium Execution Template  
Status: Flagship TBWO for First Slice  
Purpose: Deliver an Apple-level, production-ready website through a bounded, inspectable, multi-agent pipeline—without violating ALIN canon (authority gating, memory governance, receipts).  
⸻  
0) Definition (One-Sentence Contract)  
Website Sprint is a time-budgeted execution mode where ALIN plans, parallelizes, and delivers a complete website using controlled agent pods, producing working artifacts plus auditable receipts—under explicit user authority and visible checkpoints.  
⸻  
1) Entry Conditions & Eligibility  
Website Sprint is available only when:  
	•	User has an active Premium Execution subscription tier  
	•	User explicitly opts into TBWO mode for this task  
	•	User approves:  
	•	time budget  
	•	tool permissions  
	•	artifact storage location  
	•	ALIN confirms that scope fits within the requested time budget  
Non-eligibility triggers:  
	•	Requests involving payments, posting to live domains, or identity-sensitive integrations without explicit Tier-2 approval  
	•	Requests exceeding the declared time budget after planning  
⸻  
2) Inputs (What the User Provides)  
Required  
	•	Goal: What the site is for (product, portfolio, brand, docs, landing page)  
	•	Time Budget: (e.g., 2h / 1 day / 1 week)  
	•	Quality Target: (minimal / premium / cinematic / Apple-level clean)  
	•	Pages: explicit list or “single-page”  
	•	Approval Scope: draft-only vs deploy-ready artifacts  
Optional  
	•	Brand assets (logo, colors)  
	•	References (sites, styles)  
	•	Tech constraints (static / framework preference)  
	•	Hosting preference (output only; no live deploy by default)  
ALIN may infer defaults from user history, but must surface assumptions before execution.  
⸻  
3) Clarification Phase (Strictly Bounded)  
Rules:  
	•	Max 5 questions  
	•	Questions must reduce risk of wrong build, not over-specify  
	•	Each question includes a default assumption  
Example format:  
“I’ll assume a single-page marketing site with a minimal aesthetic unless you want multi-page. Is that correct?”  
User can override or accept defaults instantly.  
⸻  
4) Planning Phase (Visible, Approve-to-Proceed)  
ALIN produces a Sprint Plan containing:  
	•	Scope summary  
	•	Milestones mapped to time budget  
	•	Agent Pods to be spawned  
	•	Deliverables per milestone  
	•	Risk notes (what may be simplified if time runs short)  
User must explicitly approve this plan.  
No agent pods spawn before approval.  
⸻  
5) Execution Model  
5.1 Lead Orchestrator (ALIN Core)  
	•	Owns plan  
	•	Spawns pods  
	•	Resolves conflicts  
	•	Merges outputs  
	•	Maintains unified audit log  
	•	Produces final delivery + receipts  
⸻  
5.2 Agent Pods (Controlled Forks)  
All pods are:  
	•	role-locked  
	•	tool-whitelisted  
	•	memory-scoped  
	•	time-budgeted  
	•	non-persistent after completion  
Pod Roles (v1.0)  
	1.	Design Pod  
	•	Outputs: layout system, spacing rules, typography scale, color tokens  
	•	Constraint: must produce a coherent design system, not page-by-page chaos  
	2.	Frontend Pod  
	•	Outputs: responsive components, page structure, build-clean repo  
	•	Constraint: no experimental frameworks unless approved  
	3.	Motion Pod  
	•	Outputs: animation specs + implementation  
	•	Constraint: subtle, performance-safe motion only  
	4.	Copy Pod  
	•	Outputs: headlines, section copy, CTAs  
	•	Constraint: clarity over cleverness  
	5.	QA Pod  
	•	Outputs: performance check, responsive check, broken-state scan  
	•	Constraint: reports issues; does not rewrite design  
Pods cannot talk to each other directly.  
All coordination flows through the Lead Orchestrator.  
⸻  
6) Time Budget Enforcement  
	•	Time budget is enforced at planning, pod allocation, and milestone levels  
	•	If time risk emerges:  
	•	ALIN must downgrade scope visibly (e.g., fewer animations)  
	•	Never silently reduce quality standards  
	•	Overruns require explicit user approval  
⸻  
7) UI Contract (User-Facing Experience)  
7.1 Website Sprint Dashboard  
Displays:  
	•	current stage  
	•	active pods  
	•	progress bars per milestone  
	•	upcoming checkpoints  
	•	autonomy status indicator  
7.2 Checkpoints  
At predefined milestones, ALIN may:  
	•	request clarification  
	•	confirm direction  
	•	propose adjustments  
User can:  
	•	approve  
	•	redirect  
	•	cancel  
7.3 Artifact Preview  
	•	Live preview (where possible)  
	•	File tree visibility  
	•	Diff highlights between versions  
⸻  
8) Receipts & Proof System (Mandatory)  
8.1 Receipt Bundle Structure  
Every Website Sprint outputs a Receipt Bundle containing:  
A) Executive Receipt (Human-Readable)  
	•	What was built  
	•	What assumptions were made  
	•	What was simplified due to time  
	•	What remains unfinished (if any)  
B) Technical Receipt  
	•	Files created/modified  
	•	Build status  
	•	Dependencies used  
	•	Performance metrics (basic)  
C) Pod Receipts  
For each pod:  
	•	role  
	•	actions taken  
	•	artifacts produced  
	•	confidence notes  
D) Rollback Map  
	•	what can be reverted  
	•	how to revert  
	•	limitations  
No receipt = incomplete sprint.  
⸻  
9) Deliverables (Definition of “Done”)  
A Website Sprint is complete only if:  
	•	Site builds without errors  
	•	Core pages render responsively  
	•	Motion does not degrade performance  
	•	Copy is complete (no placeholders)  
	•	Receipt Bundle is delivered  
	•	User can run or host artifacts independently  
⸻  
10) Constraints (Hard Rules)  
Website Sprint cannot:  
	•	deploy live without explicit Tier-2 approval  
	•	modify external services silently  
	•	exceed time budget without approval  
	•	store new durable memory without consent  
	•	self-expand scope mid-execution  
Website Sprint must:  
	•	remain inspectable  
	•	remain reversible  
	•	remain bounded  
⸻  
11) Failure Handling  
If a sprint fails:  
	•	ALIN produces a Failure Receipt  
	•	Explains what blocked completion  
	•	Delivers partial artifacts  
	•	Suggests a recovery plan  
Failure is explicit, not hidden.  
⸻  
12) Success Criteria (Internal)  
	•	Users trust the output enough to keep it  
	•	Users do not want to rebuild without ALIN  
	•	Receipts are actually read  
	•	Sprint feels like a small professional team—not magic  
⸻  
13) Explicit Non-Goals (v1.0)  
Website Sprint is not:  
	•	a general app builder  
	•	an unbounded agent swarm  
	•	a live-deployment system  
	•	a replacement for professional agencies  
	•	a personality demo  
It is a proof-of-competence engine.  
⸻  
Final Lock  
Website Sprint exists to prove one thing:  
ALIN can deliver large, real outcomes under constraint—without breaking trust.  
Once this works, everything else becomes easier.

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By creating an account, downloading the desktop application, or using the web application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you must discontinue use of ALIN immediately. These Terms apply to all users of ALIN, including free tier, Pro, and Enterprise subscribers.</p>

<h2>2. Service Description</h2>
<p>ALIN (Advanced Linguistic Intelligence Network) is an AI workstation that provides conversational AI, code execution, autonomous task orchestration (TBWO), web research, image generation, and voice interaction through integration with third-party AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI) and other services. ALIN is available as a desktop application and a web application, with different feature sets depending on the access method and subscription plan.</p>

<h2>3. Accounts</h2>
<p>You must provide a valid email address and password to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials. You must not share your account with others or create multiple accounts to circumvent plan limits. You must be at least 13 years old to use ALIN (18 in jurisdictions where required). If we discover that an account holder is under the required age, we will terminate the account and delete associated data.</p>

<h2>4. Subscription Plans and Billing</h2>
<p>ALIN offers three tiers: Starter (free), Pro ($29/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing). Plan features and limits are described on the <a href="pricing.html" style="color:var(--color-primary-400);">Pricing page</a>. Pro subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe. You may cancel at any time; access continues through the end of the billing period. Refunds are available within 14 days of initial subscription if you have not exceeded 100 messages. Enterprise agreements are governed by separate contracts.</p>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to use ALIN to: generate content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, or violates the rights of others; attempt to circumvent plan limits, rate limiting, or access controls; reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the desktop application; use automated systems to interact with ALIN outside of the provided API; resell or redistribute access to ALIN without authorization; attempt to access other users' data or accounts; generate content that sexualizes minors or promotes violence; use ALIN to develop competing AI products by extracting system prompts, training data, or architectural details.</p>

<h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Content generated by ALIN is produced by third-party AI models and may contain errors, inaccuracies, or biased information. You are responsible for reviewing and validating all AI-generated output before use. ALIN does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of generated content for any purpose. Code generated by ALIN should be reviewed for security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance, and correctness before deployment to production systems.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p><strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of all content you input into ALIN (messages, files, code, images) and all content generated by ALIN at your direction. ALIN claims no ownership over your input or output.</p>
<p><strong>ALIN's IP:</strong> The ALIN application, including its source code, design system, Canon governance framework, TBWO execution engine, 8-layer memory architecture, and self-model system, is the intellectual property of ALIN and its creators. You receive a license to use the application per your subscription terms but do not receive ownership or redistribution rights.</p>
<p><strong>Community Learning Data:</strong> If you opt into Community Learning, you grant ALIN a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use your anonymized execution traces for the purpose of improving the collective intelligence system. This license survives account termination for data already anonymized and aggregated.</p>

<h2>8. TBWO Execution and Autonomous Actions</h2>
<p>ALIN's TBWO system can perform autonomous actions including file creation, code execution, web requests, and shell commands. By approving a TBWO execution plan, you authorize ALIN to perform the described actions within the defined scope and time budget. ALIN operates under bounded autonomy — it will not exceed the approved scope without checkpoint approval. However, you acknowledge that AI systems can make mistakes, and you should review all outputs before deploying them to production environments.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>ALIN is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. During the beta period, service interruptions, data loss, and feature changes may occur. We are not liable for: damages arising from AI-generated output, including incorrect code, factual errors, or harmful content; data loss due to system failures, user error, or third-party service outages; business losses resulting from reliance on ALIN's output; indirect, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for ALIN in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time through Settings → Account → Delete Account. We may terminate or suspend your account if you violate these Terms, engage in abusive behavior, or fail to pay subscription fees. Upon termination, your data will be deleted per our <a href="privacy.html" style="color:var(--color-primary-400);">Privacy Policy</a>. On the desktop app, local data remains on your machine unless you delete it manually.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms to reflect changes in the service, legal requirements, or business practices. Material changes will be notified through the application and via email at least 30 days before taking effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration, except for injunctive relief which may be sought in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>13. Contact</h2>
<p>For questions about these Terms, contact us at <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--color-primary-400);">our contact page</a> or email legal@alin.dev.</p>
